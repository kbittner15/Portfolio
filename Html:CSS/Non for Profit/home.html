	<h2>OLCA Community,</h2>
	<p> We hope everyone and their families are doing well during this time. There have been many people in our OLCA community affected by the Coronavirus and they continue to be in our thoughts and prayers.</p>
	<p>It has become clear that we will be unable to have an OLCA Spring Long Striders Season, therefore the OLCA 2020 Sports Season is officially CANCELLED.  During these next few months, the OLCA staff will be working very hard planning for our upcoming Fall Season including possible special events involving Spring and Summer.  </p>
	<p>A decision on the Summer special events will be made at a later date. The Summer Special Events will continue once we are able to return to activity.  </p>
	<p>In the next few weeks, we plan on hosting a ZOOM Video Conference with our Parish Athletic Representatives so we can virtually get together to discuss the impact on our programs, share ideas and thoughts on how parish programs are keeping in communication with their OLCA athletes and how as an organization we will continue to work together to provide the best opportunities for our wonderful children in our Long Striders programs. Once organized, we will send out the information.</p>
	<p>Each of you remains in our thoughts and prayers.  We look forward each day to seeing everyone again</p>
	<p>Please stay safe and healthy and God Bless,</p>
	<p>OLCA Staff</p>
